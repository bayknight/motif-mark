Classes: this may need to be broken down further depending on drawing)

Final Picture
DNA_Figure
Exon
Intron
Rectangle (variable size parameters)
each level can have rectangles involved

DNA figure will at its core be a thing long rectangle scaled to sequence length

Exons and Introns will need to be determined dynamically and overlay the DNA figure in the
appropriate position.

Color will be determined by motif position

Final Picture will be a series of overlays
|-----DNA_Figure(Intron backbone (might not need this might be anything thats not exon is intron))
      |----------Exon (thick rectangle on top of DNA figure)
      |----------Motif(Thick COLORED rectangle on top of DNA figure)

Considerations:
Scale needs to be determined dynamically
Exon and motif functions will need tons of logic to generate multiple of each(current thought is just overlay)

The functions will likely be complex and will be worth building and testing as i go.

Order will be :

Make Picture
Loop to make DNA_Figures (all straight line right here)
Use method for generating Exons on all DNA_Figures
use method for generating motifs in picture
